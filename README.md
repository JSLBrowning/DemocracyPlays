# TwitchPlays

These are four Python files that allows Twitch or Youtube chat to control your keyboard or mouse to play a game.

To run the code you will need to install Python 3.9. Additionally, you will need to install the following python modules using Pip:

```
python -m pip install keyboard
python -m pip install pydirectinput
python -m pip install pyautogui
python -m pip install pynput
python -m pip install requests
```

Once Python is set up, simply change the Twitch username (or Youtube channel ID) in TwitchPlays_TEMPLATE.py, and you'll be ready to go.

This code is originally based off Wituz's Twitch Plays template, then expanded by DougDoug and DDarknut with help from Ottomated for the Youtube side. Forked again on 2025/06/20 by JSLBrowning for use by the 810NICLE Day team.
